# Fight_detection_in_digital_videos_using_machine_learning
The project’s aim is to detect fights using video frames and motion spectrogram features extracted using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to trained and develop an effective and accurate fight detection system using the Hockey Fight dataset.

#Objectives
The objectives to accomplish the research’s aim are as follows:
#Exploring existing ways to fight detection and how machine learning can help with improvements.
Conduct a literature review on fight detection, with a special emphasis on digital videos utilising machine learning. Conduct a review of the past literatures on machine learning and its use in fight detection. Combine the literatures to determine the primary areas of attention, as well as relevant previous research and material to help the development for this research.
#To enable the preprocessing of features where frames and motion spectrograms are transformed and prepared for analysis.
Features are to be preprocessed, nomalization for fight detection, essential information such as video frames and motion spectrogram should be transformed in order to improve the performance of the machine learning algorithm.
#Training the CNN model architecture for detecting fights in digital videos involves using seperate features as inputs.
Proprocessed features are transformed and trained. The process of training the data (train/test sets)for the each features to using a classifier.
#Feature extraction and training of two Sigmoid function classifier which are trained with the combined frame and motion features(training and testing sets).
Extracting features using CNN, thereafter training with a classifier. The model's ability to categorise video segments is to be evaluated. This is accomplished by computing metrics such as accuracy, plots and confusion matrix, which provide information about the model's overall performance and ability to properly identify fights in the dataset. Other aspects, such as the size, and balance of the dataset, should be considered when evaluating the model's performance.
#To evaluate the process and results of the research project.
In terms of usability, evaluate the results of the machine learning application to the fight detection system. Compare the findings of this project study to earlier studies on data visualisation and machine learning. Self-reflect on the research project process, including what went well and what didn't. Determine future work directions and current study limits.
